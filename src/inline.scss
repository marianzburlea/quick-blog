// We use the inline CSS file to inject CSS into the header of each HTML
// This CSS must be as small as possible and we'll only load in the CSS needed
// for the initial content to be rendered in the browser. For this purpose we
// are using a wrapper that spans full width and height, so all the other content
// that follows will be pushed down. In our scenario, we'll have the title and
// description present, with a background for the wrapper, the continue button

// and the menu. The menu will only be present for the "main" layout. The rest
// of the CSS will be found in style.css and will be loaded at the end of the
// HTML for faster rendering, so it doesn't block other content from being loaded.
// At the moment, the inline.css is about 3Kb and the style.css is about 9Kb.
// As the app/website grows in complexity only the size of style.css should grow
// bigger. Those 3Kb will be loaded at each page request, as it's inline with
// the HTML code, and those 9Kb or more will be cached upon first visit and will
// be quickly loaded starting with second page load and forward.
